    "text": "战立侃，认知科学博士，北京语言大学副教授，主持国家社会科学基金一项，发表专著一部，SSCI或SCIE论文十余篇。\n我感兴趣的研究课题包含但不限于 “与其他动物相比，人类认知的独特性”，及其相关发展障碍。其中，与其他动物相比，人类独特性的一个重要体现是对非当时当下 (Displacement) 信息的表征能力。 该能力能在很多传统细分领域中体现出来，如感知觉、语言、社会性认知等，这些议题都本小组的课题研究范围。\n现在从事的研究主要分为两块。第一块包括语言习得和语言在线加工的行为及生理机制、言语障碍的产生原因、以及区别于动物交流系统相比人类语言的独特性等。目前研究集中于某些些句子连接词的在线理解过程，如条件连接词、吸取连接词、否定词等。\n第二块包括社会性认知如面孔识别、心理理论，和社会性认知障碍如自闭症等。目前研究集中于心理理论。本人的学术专长是利用眼动仪和脑磁仪等行为和脑成像技术对上述问题进行探索。眼动仪方面，本人熟悉相关领域的实验设计、程序编程 (如 Eprime, Psychopy, Experimental builder 等) 和数据处理 （如用 Julia 语言进行数据统计和数据可视化处理）。脑成像技术方面，熟悉脑磁图仪的基本原理、数据收集和数据处理过程 (如 fieldtrip，eeglab, MNE 等)。"

    "text": "My undergraduate major is Teaching Chinese as a Second Language. But I turned out to be more interested in the underling processes of language comprehension and language learning, rather than in the language teaching practices. Henceforth, I changed my postgraduate major to cognitive psychology. During my postgraduate study, I had training linguistics (theoretical linguistics especially generative linguistics, psycholinguistics, and neurolinguistics) and psychology (general psychology, experimental psychology, and cognitive neuroscience), as well as some experimental techniques, such as E-prime, and eye tracking techniques (Eyelink II/1000). My master’s thesis was on the interpretation of logical connectives in human language, and to investigate the topic, I also read extensively on analytic philosophy, logic, reasoning, and rationality. As an extension of my Master project, my PhD project explored the meaning of conditional connective in human language, and used it as a pivot to find the uniqueness of human language and human itself. Because of the multidisciplinary property of the project, my PhD major is cognitive science. The institution I pursued my PhD degree is the Center for Cognition and its Disorders, Macquarie University, Australia, which hosts three MEG systems. During that period, I started to use the R programming language to analyze my data and to receive systematic training on MEG such as equipment maintenance, experiment design, as well as data acquisition and analyses etc. Since 2018, I start to use Julia as a potential alternative to R to do my data analyses.\nAfter graduation, I joined Beijing Language and Culture University in 2014 as a tenured faculty member of Faculty of Language Sciences. Since 2014 up to now, I have being teaching undergraduate courses like Science and Scientific Research, Statistics for Behavioral Science, General Psychology, Experimental Psychology, and postgraduate courses like R for statistics and data visualization, Introduction to Cognitive Neuroscience, and Introduction to Neurolinguistics. I was also a core member of the application and establishment of two new undergraduate majors in the Beijing Language and Culture University: Speech and language science (Approved by Ministry of Education PRC in 2015) and Linguistics (The first linguistic major at the undergraduate level in China, approved by Ministry of Education PRC in 2018). In 2015, I was in charge of building an MEG machine there, the first child MEG machine in China. As a principle investigator, I have received one external funding from the National Social Science Fund of China (The national top-level project in philosophy and social science field in China), seven internal fundings from the Beijing Language and Culture University or Macquarie University. As a co-investigator, I have received one major project from the National Social Science Found of China, one major project from the Beijing Language and Culture University. As a co-investigator, I am also attending two university sponsored projects intending to enhance the academic level of the university. From 2014 up to now, I have published 12 peer reviewed journal articles in SSCI and/or SCIE indexed journals. I was or continues to be a peer-reviewer of Cognition, Journal of Semantcis, Language, Cogintion, and Neuroscience, First Language, Scientific Reports，Journal of Visualized Experiments, SAGE Open, and Language Teaching and Linguistic Studies (In Chinese). As a member of the academic advisory committee, I jointly organized the 24th annual conference of the International Association of Chinese Linguistics.\nOne important aspect that outperforms humankind from other animals is that human language can represent information that is not here and now, i.e., displacement. Displacements are representations referring to the past, to the future, to the events that do not exist in reality, or to a person’s belief and aim, etc. My current research pursues are in these directions. First, predictive processing. One important reason that human can efficiently comprehend the fast ongoing auditory language input is that they can preprocess the information that has not yet been but is logically possible to be encountered, i.e., predictive processing. Second, irrealis. Irrealis is a marked way that human language uses to express displacement. Disjunctives, conditionals, and epistemic modals are among those linguistic markers that signify irrealis. Third, theory of mind. Other person’s or even oneself’s internal states, such as beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc., i.e., theory of mind, are also the information that cannot be directly sensed. Effectively taking other’s belief into consideration is important both for social interaction and for language comprehension.\nMy way to pursue these topics can be described from different perspectives. From the perspective of theoretical issues, I will stress their status in and their relation to logic, analytic philosophy, reasoning, and rationality. From the perspective of research participants, I will continue with typical developed adults, and gradually extend to typical and atypical developing children. If conditions permit, I will also compare human and animals to find the uniqueness of humankind. From the perspective of research methods, I’ll continue to use the behavioral and eye-tracking techniques that I’m familiar with. I am also planning to introduce new techniques that are appropriate to the research topics, such as computational modeling, machine learning, neurophysiological (e.g., EEG/MEG), or neuroimaging (e.g., fMRI) techniques etc."
